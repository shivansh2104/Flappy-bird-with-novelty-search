NEAT stands for Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies. It is used to train neural networks via simulation and without a backward pass. It is one of the best algorithms that can be applied to reinforcement learning scenarios. However one of its shortcomings is that it often does not converge on the optimal model due to lack of exploration.
However this can be solved with a fitness function that ranks uniqueness of an agent’s moves instead of the usual in game score based fitness function. This is called Novelty Search. It believes that in evolution, mutation and complexity growth is not fitness driven, but rather Nature’s open minded willingness to discover ways to solve life’s challenges.
